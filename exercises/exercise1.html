    <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Niia Lazuli, born November 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1990 in the city of Buies Creek, North Carolina. I was born into a wealthy, white, christian, conservative family and I adopted the views of those around me as I grew up. 
        My mother was a manager for <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr> and my father was a nuclear engineer. It was a privileged life. By the time I entered highschool I was a devout <strong>Christian</strong> and <strong>Republican</strong>, harboring abhorrent views on practically every minority possible. Then I discovered I was a <em>nonbinary lesbian</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This realization completely changed the course of my life. 
        Over the span of just a few months I completely reversed my views 
        in <s>some ways</s> every way imaginable. This started with rejecting the Bible as being infallible and then my entire paradigm of the world crumbled. Thank god.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I am an anarcho-communist nonbinary lesbian who always advocates for the rights of others. I find nearly every principle I was raised on to be completely atrocious. It frightens me to think of the person I could have become had my life not taken this sharp turn.
    </p>
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>
     I hope to become a university professor. 
     After finishing undergrad I plan to go on to a six year PhD program. 
     I may need to get a master’s degree first if my GPA isn’t high enough
     to immediately get into a PhD program.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have a passion for teaching and I would love to combine that with 
     my passion for computer science. I have worked in the field of 
     computer science and it really isn’t for me. Teaching would be my ideal profession.
