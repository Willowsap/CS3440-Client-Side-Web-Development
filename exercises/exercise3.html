    <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Barry Bluejeans, born January 22<sup>nd</sup>, 
        1994 in the city of Raleigh, North Carolina. 
        I was born into a wealthy, white, christian, conservative family 
        and I adopted the views of those around me as I grew up. 
        My mother was a manager for 
        <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr> 
        and my other mother was a stay-at-home mom. It was a privileged life. 
        By the time I entered highschool I was a devout 
        <strong>Christian</strong> and <strong>Republican</strong>, 
        harboring abhorrent views on practically every minority possible. 
        Then I discovered I was a <em>really, profoundly gay</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This realization completely changed the course of my life. 
        Over the span of just a few months I completely reversed my views 
        in <s>some ways</s> every way imaginable. 
        This started with rejecting the Bible as being infallible 
        and then my entire paradigm of the world crumbled. Thank god.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I am an anarcho-communist activist who always advocates 
        for the rights of others. I find nearly every principle I was raised 
        on to be completely atrocious. It frightens me to think of the 
        person I could have become had my life not taken this sharp turn.
    </p>
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>
        I hope to become a university professor. 
        After finishing undergrad I plan to go on to a six year PhD program. 
        I may need to get a master’s degree first if my GPA isn’t high enough
        to immediately get into a PhD program.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a passion for teaching and I would love to combine that with 
        my passion for computer science. I have worked in the field of 
        computer science and it really isn’t for me. 
        Teaching would be my ideal profession.
