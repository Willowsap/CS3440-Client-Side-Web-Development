    <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Barry Bluejeans, born January 22<sup>nd</sup>, 
        1994 in the city of Raleigh, North Carolina. 
        I was born into a wealthy, white, christian, conservative family 
        and I adopted the views of those around me as I grew up. 
        My mother was a manager for 
        <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr> 
        and my other mother was a stay-at-home mom. It was a privileged life. 
        By the time I entered highschool I was a devout 
        <strong>Christian</strong> and <strong>Republican</strong>, 
        harboring abhorrent views on practically every minority possible. 
        Then I discovered I was a <em>really, profoundly gay</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This realization completely changed the course of my life. 
        Over the span of just a few months I completely reversed my views 
        in <s>some ways</s> every way imaginable. 
        This started with rejecting the Bible as being infallible 
        and then my entire paradigm of the world crumbled. Thank god.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I am an anarcho-communist activist who always advocates 
        for the rights of others. I find nearly every principle I was raised 
        on to be completely atrocious. It frightens me to think of the 
        person I could have become had my life not taken this sharp turn.
    </p>
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>
        I hope to become a university professor. 
        After finishing undergrad I plan to go on to a six year PhD program. 
        I may need to get a master’s degree first if my GPA isn’t high enough
        to immediately get into a PhD program.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a passion for teaching and I would love to combine that with 
        my passion for computer science. I have worked in the field of 
        computer science and it really isn’t for me. 
        Teaching would be my ideal profession.
    </p>

        <dt>Hue</dt>
            <dd>Hue defines pure color in terms of "green", "red" or "magenta". 
                Hue also defines mixtures of two pure colors like "red-yellow" 
                (~ "orange"), or "yellow-green". Hue is usually one property 
                of three when used to determine a certain color.
                Hue is a more technical definition of our color perception 
                which can be used to communicate color ideas.
                Hue ranges from 0° to 359° when measured in degrees.
                Hues are basic colors we learn to connect with words as children.
                Hues can refer to the set of "pure" colors within a color space.</dd>
        <dt>Saturation</dt>
            <dd>Saturation is a color term commonly used by 
                (digital / analog) imaging experts.
                Saturation is usually one property of three when 
                used to determine a certain color and measured as 
                percentage value. Saturation defines a range from 
                pure color (100%) to gray (0%) at a constant lightness level. 
                A pure color is fully saturated. From a perceptional 
                point of view saturation influences the grade of purity or 
                vividness of a color/image. A desaturated image is said to 
                be dull, less colorful or washed out but can also make the 
                impression of being softer.</dd>
        <dt>Brightness</dt>
            <dd>Brightness is an attribute of our perception which is mainly influenced 
                by a color's lightness. This is probably why brightness and lightness are 
                often mixed up. Brightness is not a color property, if used "correctly".
                For one color of specific hue the perception of brightness is also more 
                intense, if we increase saturation. A higher level of saturation makes a 
                color look brighter. In relation to other colors the brightness intensity 
                of a color is also influenced by its hue. We can then speak of (relative) 
                luminance to refer to brightness.</dd>
        <dt>Opacity</dt>
            <dd>Opacity is a value from 0 to 1 where 0 is completely transparent and 1 
                is completely visible. Being transparent means that whatever element
                that the attribute is being applied to can be seen through. Being opaque
                means that it cannot be seen through. Opacity refers to how much it can
                be seen through.</dd>
        <dt>Contrast</dt>
            <dd>Higher contrast means that a color is brighter; it stands out more.
                Lower contrast means that it is dimmer and stands out less. This
                really only has meaning when comparing it with another color.
                Brighter colors have a stronger contrast with colors next to them
                which is why contrast affects a single color in this manner.
            </dd>
        <dt>Lightness</dt>
            <dd>Lightness is a color term commonly used by (digital / analog) imaging experts.
                Lightness is usually one property of three when used to determine a certain 
                color and measured as percentage value.
                Lightness defines a range from dark (0%) to fully illuminated (100%). 
                Any original hue has the average lightness level of 50%.
                A painter might say lightness is the range from fully shaded to fully tinted.
                You can lighten or darken a color by changing its lightness value.</dd>

            <dd>No longer used: The opacity attribute has replaced it</dd>
